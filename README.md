## Challenge 1
Here is the excel spreadsheet link: [Kickstarter.xlsx](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module1-Challenge/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx?raw=true) for downloading.

## Introduction
In this analysis, there are two questions need to finish:
1. Does the length of time contribute to the success or failure for a campaign?
2. How many Kickstarter campaigns were able to be close to their goals in a short term or long term?

Before analysis, there are some definitions of different points for the dataset:
- *A Kickstarter campaign* is a row in the spreadsheet with a unique ID and other information.
- *Close to the goal* means that a campaign has 90% or more Funding.
