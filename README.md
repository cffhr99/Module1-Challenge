# Module 1: An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Challenge 1
Here is the excel spreadsheet link: [Kickstarter.xlsx](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module1-Challenge/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx?raw=true) for downloading.

## Introduction
In this analysis, there are two questions need to finish:
1. Does the length of time contribute to the success or failure for a campaign?
2. How many Kickstarter campaigns were able to be close to their goals in a short term?

Before analysis, there are some definitions of different points for the dataset:
- *A Kickstarter campaign* is a row in the spreadsheet with a unique ID and other information.
- *Close to the goal* means that a campaign has 90% or more funds.
- *Length of a campaign* is the different time between *the Date Ended Conversion* and *the Date Created Conversion*.
- *Short term* means the length of a campaign is shorter than 1st quartile.
- *Success* means that a campaign has 100% funds or more. Otherwise is *Failure*.

## Analysis
### Part 1: Analyzing Outcomes Based On Launch Date for Theater Parent Category
The graph below is the line plot on the summary of outcomes for success, failure and cancelation under each month.
![Outcomes on Launch Date for Theather](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module1-Challenge/blob/main/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png?raw=true)

#### Observations:
1) From the plot above, May and June are the two month with the most Theater campaigns launched.
2) Also, May and June have the highest number of successful outcomes for Theater campaigns.

#### Suggetions:
Louise needs to consider launch her campaign in May or June to get a higher chance for success.

### Part 2: Analyzing Outcomes Based on Goals for Plays Subcategory
The graph below is the line plot about the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on their goals.
![Outcomes vs Goals](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module1-Challenge/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png?raw=true)
#### Observations:
1) There are 84% of the Plays campaigns with a goal of less than $10,000. 
2) Also, there are 75.81% of the Plays campaigns to success in finishing the goal which is less than $1,000.
3) The second highest percentage of success, which is 72.66%, is at the Plays campaigns with a goal between $1,000 and $4,999.
4) Then, the line plot of success becomes decreasing until the goals\` ranges are from   $35,000 to $39,999 and from $40,000 to $44,999.
5) From overall, successful line and failed line are symmetric. And the highest two failed ranges are from $25,000 to $29,999 and from $45,000 to $49,999.
#### Suggestions:
Louise needs to consider to set the fundraising goal below $4,999 to have a higher chance of success.

## Conclusion:
According to these two analysis above, there are two suggestions to Louise:
- Launch the campaign in May or Jun.
- Set the fundraising goal below $4,999.

However, these two conclusions may not be accurate and cohesive since some additional analysis are needed to support the conclusions. For instance:
- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Length of Campaign
- Analysis of Descriptive Statistics( like Mean, Median and IQR)
## Additional Analysis
The table below is the descriptive statistics on Plays subcategory.

#### Observations:
1) There are more than half Plays campaigns between 21 and 31 days.
2) The plays campaigns, which are between 11 tp 21 days, have the highest percentage of success.
3) Based on the data point definition, there are 179 Plays campaigns out of 1066 total Plays campaigns to be close or finish their goals in a short term.

#### Additional Suggestions:
- Louise needs
